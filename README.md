# WEATHER
The Weather Status project is a Python script that uses OpenCage Geocoding and OpenWeatherMap APIs to fetch weather information for a city and date. Users input the city name and date to get temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description. A simple yet effective solution for accessing accurate weather details.
