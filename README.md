# Weather Status Project

The Weather Status Project is a Python script that retrieves weather information for a given city and date using the OpenCage Geocoding and OpenWeatherMap APIs.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- Python 3 installed on your machine
- API keys for both OpenCage Geocoding and OpenWeatherMap services. You can sign up for API keys at their respective websites:
  - OpenCage Geocoding: [https://opencagedata.com/](https://opencagedata.com/)
  - OpenWeatherMap: [https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the script file (`weather.py`) to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

3. Replace the placeholder API keys in the script with your actual API keys. Open the `weather.py` file and update the following lines:

   ```python
   # Replace 'YOUR_GEOCODING_API_KEY' with your actual OpenCage Geocoding API key
   geocoding_api_key = 'YOUR_GEOCODING_API_KEY'
   # Replace 'YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY' with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key
   weather_api_key = 'YOUR_WEATHER_API_KEY'
   ```

## Usage

To use the Weather Status Project, follow these steps:

1. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   python weather.py
   ```

2. Enter the name of the city for which you want to retrieve the weather information when prompted.

3. Enter the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD` for which you want to fetch the weather status.

4. The script will retrieve the latitude and longitude for the specified city using the OpenCage Geocoding API. The `get_coordinates` function in the script makes a GET request to the OpenCage Geocoding API with the city name and API key as parameters. It then extracts the latitude and longitude from the JSON response and returns them.

5. The script will then fetch the weather data for the given date at the obtained coordinates using the OpenWeatherMap API. The `get_weather_status` function in the script makes a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API with the latitude, longitude, API key, and date as parameters. It extracts the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description from the JSON response and displays them on the console.

6. The weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and description, will be displayed on the console.
